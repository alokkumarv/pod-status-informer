# ðŸš¦ Pod Health Dashboard Controller

A lightweight Kubernetes controller built in Go that watches Pods in the cluster and exposes a live REST API to display their health status.

This project uses Kubernetes **client-go informers** to efficiently cache and monitor real-time pod updates, making it scalable and production-ready.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- âœ… Watches all Pods in the cluster using informers
- âœ… Supports real-time caching of pod health info
- âœ… Exposes a REST API:
  - `GET /pods?labelSelector=app=nginx` â€” List matching pods with status
  - `GET /summary?labelSelector=app=nginx` â€” Count of pods by status
- âœ… Query-time filtering using label selectors
